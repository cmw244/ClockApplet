ClockApplet
===========

Implementation of a binary clock using custom build timers that operate on threads

To use the clock:

single left-click: toggles state of dot being clicked on.
double left-click(without shift key): resets clock to 0
double left-click(with shift key): sets the clock to the current time
Current time is defined as the number of seconds since 00:00 (UTC) January 1st, 1970.  
middle-click: Reverses direction of the clock
right-click: starts and stops the clock
